## Project Summary

**Choicr** is a platform for decision making. Its url was [choicr.com](#).

This was the first major project that I, [Jamie Howard](http://jamiehoward.co), and my brother, [John Howard](https://twitter.com/blkairpln) built together. I built the entire first iteration of the site in procedural PHP code. When another developer suggested to John that I try CodeIgniter, I rebuilt the entire site to be what is currently here. 

The site was not a success, but it wasn't due to the poor code, so it stands as a great reminder of building something even when it's not perfect. The code is so bad that I'm tempted to be embarrassed, but I'm not because since then, I've learned to write better code. As long as we keep making things better, we'll be alright.
